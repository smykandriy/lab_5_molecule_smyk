Write a class Molecule, which consists of certain number of atoms. Create class Atom having such data: name, atomic mass unit, neutrons number, protons number, electrons number. Add enum type: ISOTYPE, RADIOACTIVE, ION, ANTIMATTER, STABLE.

Add some functions: To sort atoms by atomic mass. To find the average mass of atoms among the given ones. Method isNeutral(self) to the Atom class: if the sum of the number of neutrons and electrons is equal, then return True, otherwise - False.
